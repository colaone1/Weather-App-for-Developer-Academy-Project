This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Weather App Backend & Testing Utilities

A robust Node.js backend for a weather application, built with Koa. Provides weather and forecast data via RESTful API endpoints, with error handling, logging, rate limiting, and security best practices.

## Features
- Fetch current weather by city or coordinates
- Fetch forecast by city or coordinates
- Health check endpoint
- Error handling and logging (Winston)
- Rate limiting and security middleware
- Comprehensive testing setup

## Getting Started (Backend)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm

### Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/colaone1/Weather-App-Full-Stack-Repo.git
cd "Weather App Full Stack Working"
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file or set these variables:
- `APPID` — Your OpenWeatherMap API key (default provided, but you should use your own for production)
- `PORT` — Port to run the server (default: 8000)

### Running the Server
```sh
npm start
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```sh
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test types
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run E2E tests with UI
npm run cypress:open
```

### Test Structure
```
tests/
├── setup/
│   └── setupTests.js      # Global test configuration
├── utils/
│   └── testUtils.js       # Common testing utilities
├── factories/
│   └── weatherFactory.js  # Test data factories
└── frontend/
    └── snapshot.test.js   # Snapshot tests
```

### Test Coverage
The project maintains a minimum test coverage of 80% for:
- Branches
- Functions
- Lines
- Statements

View coverage reports by running:
```sh
npm run test:coverage
```

### Automated Testing
The project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing:
- Runs on every push to master
- Runs on pull requests
- Executes linting, unit tests, and E2E tests
- Uploads coverage reports to Codecov

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
`GET /health`
- Returns: `{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "..." }`

### Get Weather by City
`GET /api/weatherbycity?city=London`

### Get Weather by Coordinates
`GET /api/weatherbycoordinates?lon=-0.1276&lat=51.5074`

### Get Forecast by City
`GET /api/forecast?city=London`

### Get Forecast by Coordinates
`GET /api/forecastbycoordinates?lon=-0.1276&lat=51.5074`

## Logging & Security
- Logs are written to `error.log` and `combined.log`.
- Rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP.
- Security headers are set for all responses.
